# Notes from the Dev
-If you have `node-opus` installed, use that instead of `opusscript`.

-Due to the rewrite I can't get the `skip` function working. The only workaround is to listen the whole song or enter the `stop` command and play another one.

-It's still in beta. Soo... Expect some bugs crawling around.

# Actual readme comming soonâ„¢

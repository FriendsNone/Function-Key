# Notes from the Dev
-The `help` command doesn't updates for new command files. You'll have to update it manually. Sorry about that :P

-Staff commands (`off`, `mute`, `umute`) doesn't check for roles and permissions. Stay Safe!

-There's no proper moderation commands yet. Stay updated with that!

-It's sort of stable... But! Expect some bugs crawling around.
